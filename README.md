# flight_info_screen

Brief

Use your favourite JavaScript framework and libraries. We use React, but you're welcome to use another if you like
The flight information should be updated regularly to ensure the flight information shown to the user is up to date
Please .gitignore the node_modules directory!
The solution should be simple, but think about how it could fit in to a bigger project (reusable components, etc)
